# Appendix D - Growth & Evolution

As the OCME ecosystem moves beyond the closed-loop Voyager pilot, more and more of the ecosystem governance will be codified.

Key areas that are being considered are:

## D.1 Risk Assessment

Identifying key risks, assessing them, and identifying vulnerabilities is crucial as the OCME ecosystem grows. Creating a risk treatment plan will assist in mitigating, accepting, avoiding, and transferring risks.

## D.2 Trust Assurance and Certification

Establishing levels of assurance and the conformance and compliance criteria that support those levels of assurance will require formalization of much of the ecosystem. As the trust assurance and certification are created auditors will be engaged to assist in building out a solid conformance and compliance scheme.

## D.3 Governance Requirements

As the closed-loop pilot is run, the OCME founders and other trust community members will be gathering and formalizing requirements.

## D.4 Business Requirements

After the closed-loop pilot is run, the trust community will be consulted to determine where value is being created and how that should be recognized.

## D.5 Technical Requirements

In the initial “closed loop” stage all technical requirements are under consideration. Specific tools will be used, while interoperability will be considered for the OCME as it goes beyond the “closed loop” pilot.

Key limitations:

- Wallet application will be limited to ALTME Wallet
- Issuing will be done using Polygon ID or another SSI technology
- Interactions will be proprietary.

All of the key interactions will eventually be open standard/open protocol based.

## D.6 Inclusion, Equitability, and Accessibility Requirements

OCME is committed to promoting fair and equal access to the OCME ecosystem for all individuals and organizations. Our GF will enable and promote inclusion, equitability, and accessibility.

## D.7 Legal Agreements

OCME will enter into legal agreements with relevant stakeholders as necessary. These agreements will be developed and executed as components of the GF. They will be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with the GF specifications. 

These agreements may include but are not limited to service-level agreements with vendors and suppliers, data processing agreements with processors, and confidentiality agreements with partners and clients. OCME will develop all legal agreements with the assistance of legal counsel to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

# Appendix E - Revenue Splits

In the early days of OCME, the revenue will be split in two major streams:
- Creator Stream: This is revenue allocated to the Creator and the systems, organizations, and people that support them.
- Curator and Infrastructure Stream: This stream is about rewarding the Curator for generating an audience and keeping the infrastructure components running. Over time the infrastructure portion is intended to decrease but initial costs are high. 

This will be allocated on the following basis:
- 60% of all revenue to Creator Stream
- 17.5% of all revenue to the Curator
- 17.5% of all revenue to the Infrastructure Provider
- 5% of all revenue to the ecosystem managed by the IAC.
